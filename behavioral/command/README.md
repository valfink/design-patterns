# Command

- problem: no way to undo java statements
- solution: an object that represents an operation -> Command pattern
- an object which represents an instruction to perform a particular action
- it contains all the information necessary for the action to be taken
- there must be a method for applying the command (either in the Command object or in the object on which it is working)
