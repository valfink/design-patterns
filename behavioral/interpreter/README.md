# Interpreter

- an interpreter takes textual input that needs to be processed, for example turned into OOP structures
- examples:
  - regular expressions
  - numeric expressions (3+4/5)
  - IDE with code help
- typically, the text is first converted into lexical tokens (lexing), which then are interpreted in sequences (parsing)
- probably the most well-known Interpreter framework is ANTLR
