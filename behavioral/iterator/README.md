# Iterator

- an object that facilitates the traversal of a data structure
- it keeps a reference to the current element
- it knows how to move to a different element
- Iterator cannot be recursive (probably only in Java?)
- Iterator implements `Iterator<T>`, iterable object implements `Iterable<T>`
